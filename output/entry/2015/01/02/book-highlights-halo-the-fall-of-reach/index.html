      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the first book set in the Halo universe, Eric Nylund's <em>Halo: The Fall of
Reach</em> describes the training and induction of the first-ever Spartans,
including <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/John-117">John-117</a>, the Master Chief. It
follows the Spartans through some of their earliest missions, depicts humanity's
first contact with the <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Covenant_Empire">Covenant</a>,
and culminates in the battle for planet Reach, a human colony. I don't often
read fiction, and I am not sure I've ever before read "expanded universe"
fiction for a game or a movie, so <em>Halo: The Fall of Reach</em> was a bit of an
unusual read for me. However, since I really enjoy the <em>Halo</em> games, universe,
and characters, and since this book came highly recommended by other fans of the
series, I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, per my <a href="/about/#review_policy">review policy</a>, I can't actually
review this book: the <em>Halo</em> series, and indeed the copyright to the book, is
owned by Microsoft, by whom I am employed by. Instead, I want to highlight a
few things that I found interesting in the book. <strong>Be warned that this post will
contain some spoilers for the book and other parts of the <em>Halo</em> series.</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've never been involved in professional game development, but my
  understanding is that game mechanics and environments are typically built
  first, with story added later in the development process; this necessarily
  means that the plot is shoehorned into a set of scenarios and environments
  that might not actually be an optimal fit for it. This in turn is one of the
  reasons video game writing is notoriously mediocre. To the extent that this is
  true, it is especially true of the first game in a new franchise. However,
  <em>Halo: The Fall of Reach</em> was actually originally published on October 30th,
  2001, about two weeks <em>before</em> <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> was released. This shows
  that Bungie had an impressively thorough understanding of the universe they
  were building at that relatively early stage in the franchise's life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, much of that universe might still have been conceived in a
 short amount of time. In an afterword to the <em>Halo: The Fall of Reach</em>,
 <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Frank_O%27Connor">Frank O'Connor</a> writes
 that "[t]he book went from conception to final print in a staggering four
 months." That is certainly impressive for 352-page book!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the book, Spartans in MJOLNIR armor are able to sprint at
  superhuman speeds: "The Chief and his team sprinted up the half-kilometer
  sandstone slope in thirty-two seconds flat." That is a speed of 35 miles per
  hour (56.2km/h) on an upward slope. This is somewhat at odds with the
  relatively sluggish pace of movement in the first three Halo games. However,
  sprinting was fairly unpopular when it was added to the game series, as
  many people felt that it changed multiplayer balance for the worse. (I don't
  personally have an opinion on that, but obviously, gameplay balance is more
  important than being accurate to lore.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the subject of gameplay being at odds with lore, the game <em>Halo: Reach</em>
 also depicts the fall of Reach, but from the perspective of a group of Spartans
 on the ground rather than from the Master Chief's perspective. It also
 infamously retcons some significant portions of the plot laid out in <em>The Fall
 of Reach</em>. I haven't actually played <em>Halo: Reach</em> in several years, but going
 back and reading the plot summary
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Reach">on Wikipedia</a>, I can immediately see
 a number of differences from the events depicted in the book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final warning: spoilers begin here!</strong> At the beginning of <em>Halo: Combat
 Evolved</em>, the UNSC ship <em>Pillar of Autumn</em> is supposed to have made a random
 <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Slipstream_Space">slipspace</a> jump to retreat from
 a Covenant fleet&mdash;it's not mentioned in the game that the ship is
 retreating from the lost battle for Reach. This is how the humanity first
 happens upon the Halo rings (and, in fact, how the Covenant find them as well).
 I always had trouble suspending disbelief that a jump to some <em>random</em> point in
 the universe would result in the discovery of one of the handful of Halo rings
 that exist.  But it turns out that the jump wasn't actually random: Cortana
 chose the jump coordinates based on ancient navigation symbols found on an
 artifact that the Master Chief had recovered from the Covenant after they
 invaded the human colony world of Sigma Octanus IV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, I had trouble suspending disbelief about the concept of
 <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Rampancy">AI rampancy</a>, at least as described in
 the game, when it was introduced in <em>Halo 4</em>. Frankly, I thought the whole
 thing was a fairly stupid plot device. But, actually, rampancy <em>wasn't</em>
 introduced in <em>Halo 4</em>; it was a known phenomenon in the Halo universe right
 from the start, and is mentioned at the same time as Cortana is introduced.
 I'm still not sure I'm totally on board with the concept, but it does feel
 less idiosyncratic now that I know that it was established long before being
 reintroduced in <em>Halo 4</em>. Originally, I viewed it as something 343 added to
 introduce tension to the romantic subplot between Cortana and the Master Chief,
 but it turns out they were actually strictly following existing lore the whole
 time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cortana was a "smart" AI, an advanced artificial construct. Actually, the
terms <em>smart</em> and <em>dumb</em> as applied to AIs, were misleading; all AIs were
extraordinarily intelligent. But Cortana was special.</p>
<p>So-called dumb AIs within the set limits of their dynamic memory-processing
matrix were brilliant in their fields but were lacking in "creativity." DÃ©jÃ ,
for example, was a "dumb" AI&mdash;incredibly useful, but limited.</p>
<p>Smart AIs like Cortana, however, had no limits on their dynamic
memory-processor matrix. Knowledge and creativity could grow unchecked.</p>
<p>She would pay a price for her genius, however. Such growth eventually led to
self-interference. Cortana would one day literally start thinking too much at
the expense of her normal functions. It was as if a human were to think with
so much of his brain that he stopped sending impulses to his heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Like all other smart AIs that Dr. Halsey had worked with over the years,
Cortana would effectively "die" after an operational life of seven years.</p>
</blockquote>
