      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you've ever read OkCupid's popular <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">OkTrends</a> blog,
you're already familiar with the work of Christian Rudder. As OkCupid's resident
mathematician and one of its founders, he has been writing for years about
statistical trends related to dating and attraction, leveraging OkCupid's
vast database of traits about, and interactions between, its millions and millions
of users. OkTrends produced numerous interesting and surprising results, and it
developed a significant following before going quiet for the better part of
three years beginning in 2011.</p>
<p>Now, Rudder is back with
<a href="http://dataclysm.org/"><em>Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking</em></a>,
which expands on OkTrends by drawing from a wider variety of sources (including
Facebook, Google, and Twitter, in addition to OkCupid and other dating sites)
and discussing a more diverse set of topics.  Organized into three themed
sections which focus on, respectively, unity, division, and individuality, the
book explores what data can tell us about gender, sexuality, race, identity,
community, and other sociopolitical questions.  The discussion is consistently
balanced and neutral, which is important when dealing with such potentially
charged subjects, but Rudder also manages to inject enough of his personality
and characteristic style to keep the book enjoyable throughout.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the OkTrends blog was popular not only for the fascinating observations
it produced, but also for Rudder's accessible and entertaining writing style,
and he continues this to great effect in Dataclysm. No mathematical or
statistical knowledge whatsoever is required to understand the topics discussed
in the book; data are presented in the form of simple graphs and explained using
plain English with a minimum of jargon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this focus on accessibility also gives rise to my biggest
criticism of the book: on the spectrum of "pop science" writing, <em>Dataclysm</em> is
decidedly more pop than science. In and of itself, that isn't a problem per se,
but in many instances I felt that a more methodical approach could have led to a
broader and more productive discussion.  Rudder is not nearly thorough enough in
describing the methodology by which he arrived at his conclusions, nor in
presenting (or at least making available) salient facts about the data he used,
nor in exploring alternative hypotheses.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following graph of the "perception of male vs. female
attractiveness" from the introduction. On the x-axis is the average of all
ratings (on a 1-5 star scale) received by a user, and on the y-axis is the
percentage of all users that received that average rating:</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/men_women_attractiveness.png" alt="Attractiveness of women as
rated by men and vice versa"/><br />
<small>Copyright 2014 Christian Rudder. Used under Fair Use.</small>
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Rudder explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our real-world data [of women's attractiveness as rated by men] diverges only
slightly (6 percent) from this formulaic ideal [of a symmetric beta
distribution] ... it implies that the individual men who did the scoring are
likewise predictable, centered, and above all, unbiased... It's practically
common sense that men should have unrealistic expectations of women's looks,
and yet here we see it's just not true.</p>
<p>The red chart [of men's attractiveness as rated by women] is cenetered barely
a quarter of the way up the scale; only one in six guys is "above average" in
an absolute sense... [as an analogy,] translate this plot to IQ, and you have
a world where women think 58% of men are brain damaged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is certainly interesting data in its own right, but I don't think Rudder
goes far enough in exploring what it means or why it might be the case. By
comparing against a similar random sample from a social network, he determines
that it is <em>not</em> because men on OkCupid are unusually ugly&mdash;this pattern
persists beyond dating sites. His hypothesis is simply that "men and women
perform a different sexual calculus," and, quoting <em>Harper's Magazine</em>, he notes
that "women are inclinded to regret the sex they had, and men the sex they
didn't."</p>
<p>This is certainly a plausible explanation, and it's intuitively appealing, but
it also seems like a bit of a cop out based stereotypical beliefs about gender
differences. I'd like to see data about how straight men and women rate the
attractiveness of people of their own gender&mdash;although not directly
analogous since it would be divorced from sexual desire, I suspect that the
results might raise questions about Rudder's hypothesis here.</p>
<p>In the interest of fairness, I must restate that his discussion takes place in
the book's introduction, so it's not representative of the length at which other
findings in the book are discussed. Most likely, it's just meant to pique the
reader's interest and serve as an example of the kind of data the book will
examine. Nevertheless, similar issues persist in later chapters of the book.
Consider this map of responses to the question "Should flag burning be illegal?"
among OkCupid users:</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/dataclysm_flag_burning.png" alt="Map of answers to the
question: Should flag burning be illegal?"/><br />
<small>Copyright 2014 Christian Rudder. Used under Fair Use.</small>
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Rudder claims that this map demonstrates that "this is truly a nation defined by
its principles, or, as you can see, <em>two</em> nations: Urban and Rural." But to my
eyes, the colors overlap too much to make a meaningful distinction; this
really just looks like a population map. What's more, it appears to include
Canadian responses even though I can only assume that Rudder is referring the US
when he writes "<em>a</em> nation," singular. And again, there is no discussion of
important methodological questions or possible confounding factors, such as
whether OkCupid's user base is disproportionately urban (which doesn't seem
unlikely to me), and whether or not that was corrected for if so.</p>
<p>Rudder anticipates criticism of his decision to eschew "statistical esoterica,"
and defends it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't mention confidence intervals, sample sizes, p values, and similar
devices in <em>Dataclysm</em> because the book is above all a popularization of data
and data science... But like the spars and crossbeams of a house, the rigor is
no less present for being unseen. Many of the findings of the book are drawn
from academic, peer-reviewed sources. I applied the same standards to the
research I did myself...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fully accept that there is a place for and a value to "popularization" of
scientific fields, and that it's sensible to exclude complex statistical
measures which would be meaningless to most readers... <em>from the main body of
the text</em>. But I don't see why Rudder didn't even see fit to include these as
footnotes or endnotes, which the book does have. And with respect to the
academic research used, Rudder relegates all of his citations to endnotes, which
usually link back to the text referring to them, but are not linked to <em>from</em>
that text, which can make it very hard to match up specific statements with the
studies supporting them.</p>
<p>All of this criticism notwithstanding, I really enjoyed reading <em>Dataclysm</em>, and
I would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in gaining insight into the
social and political identities of (primarily American) Internet users. Anyone
interested in the burgeoning field of data science would also likely enjoy this
book. It's just worth noting that some of Rudder's conclusions should be taken
with a healthy dose of skepticism until they can be replicated with rigor that
<em>is</em> seen.</p></div>
