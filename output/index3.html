      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I've been using Wordpress on various sites that I've maintained for probably the
better part of a decade now. By most metrics, it's still very good blogging
software; I'm not aware of any self-hostable alternative that can match
Wordpress in terms of the union of ease of use, feature set and flexibility that
it provides. That said, lately I've been feeling that perhaps Wordpress is no
longer the right choice for my specific needs. These are my problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not very good for sharing source code. There are a multitude of plugins
  available for syntax highlighting; the best of them seems to be
  <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchev's Syntax Highlighter</a>,
  which is used by
  <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> and is also what I was using on my blog.
  But I've had problems with the Wordpress converting some of the characters in
  my code to HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;amp;</code> for &amp; ) which are then printed
  literally by the plugin.</li>
<li>I find that more often than not Wordpress' visual editor is
  insufficient for the formatting I want in my posts. That forces me to use
  the raw HTML editor. That would be fine, except that Wordpress has a strange
  sort of off-spec way of storing post HTML. Paragraph and line break tags are
  omitted in the editor and the database, and are added when the page is
  actually rendered to the client. This is okay, I guess, and I <em>think</em>
  Wordpress is smart enough to not insert extra paragraph tags if you do wrap
  your own paragraphs with them. Still, it leads to some unpredictability with
  regard to how a post with hand-written HTML will actually be rendered.</li>
<li>A similar but worse problem occurs when you try to insert extra line breaks.
  Even if you're using the raw HTML editor to insert <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags, Wordpress
  will just get rid of them unless you insert additional non-breaking spaces
  (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) so that it thinks the lines are non-empty. But! If you switch back
  to the visual editor for any reason, even your <code>&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;</code> lines will be
  wiped out. Even for "average" users I can't think of any situation in which
  this "feature" would be desirable. If I put a bunch of extra newlines into
  something I'm writing, it is because <em>I want exactly that many newlines.</em> I
  tend to not have much patience for software that thinks it's smarter than
  I am; that is why I still write most of my code in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
  and use hand-written makefiles in an age of
  <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>s.</li>
<li>Never-ending updates. It seems like every time I log in there's a new update
  to download. Wordpress has updates down to a one-click install process, so
  this wouldn't be much of a problem except for the fact that
  every time I have to update Wordpress warns me that I should back up my
  database first. Why? Is there a significant possibility that the update might
  break everything? It's probably just a
  <acronym title="Cover Our Asses">COA</acronym>, and I back up my database
  daily anyway, but this whole aspect of Wordpress makes me uneasy and I don't
  want to have to deal with it any more. Even though I'm covered for backups,
  recovering from a botched update would undoubtedly be a nightmare.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#Vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities.</a> One
  of the big reasons that Wordpress is updated so frequently is that it has a
  long history of security vulnerabilities, and more are still being discovered
  and patched. This also means that if I don't log in frequently enough to
  download new security patches, I'm at risk of having my site compromised,
  loaded up with malware and blacklisted by Google.</li>
<li>It's written in PHP. <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP sucks.</a>
  (I can't link to that enough.) I don't want to be dogmatic about technology
  choices; good software is good software regardless of what language it's
  written in, and my primary desire is always to use whatever is best for the
  task at hand. But lately I've been pretty vocal, both here and in person with
  friends and colleagues, about how bad PHP is. Continuing to rely on it
  undermines my credibility on the issue and makes me a bit of a hypocrite.</li>
</ul>
<p>And while this might seem trivial or pedantic, it's
  actually one of the root causes of almost all of the issues above; the weird
  HTML handling, inappropriate entity conversion, and security issues are all
  due, at least in part, to bad design patterns popularized and perpetuated by
  PHP. Wordpress still uses raw non-parameterized SQL queries; blogging software
  built on a modern web framework with a proper
  <acronym title="Object-Relational Mapping">ORM</acronym>
  would not be plagued by SQL
  injection exploits as Wordpress has been historically and probably continues
  to be.
- Wordpress supports themes so that you can customize the apperance of your
  site, but editing them kind of sucks, because they're all written in PHP
  instead of a proper templating language. Years ago I actually wrote a lot of
  PHP, but I still find Wordpress templates pretty ugly and difficult to
  understand; they seem more verbose than should really be necessary for what
  they accomplish, and have, on average, more <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> sections than a
  keyboard has keys. (That analogy sucked. Sorry, it's late. What I'm trying to
  say is that there are a lot of them.)</p>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm not usually much enamoured with interview-style programming puzzles because I find that a lot of them are actually more akin to math problems, trivial to implement once you figure out the salient mathematical property.  I think I have a decent intuition for math, and I certainly took enough math courses in high school and college to give me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of algebra, geometry, statistics, calculus, etc., but I'm not confident enough in my math skills to be entirely comfortable being judged by my ability to exercise them.</p>
<p>There are some programming puzzles I really enjoy, though.  This evening I happened across one such puzzle, via <a title="@eevee on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/eevee" target="_blank">Eevee's Twitter</a>: "<a title="Reversing the Interview Process - Exodus Intelligence" href="http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/09/18/reversing-the-interview-process/" target="_blank">implement a strlen() function in C that, when compiled, would not contain any conditional branches</a>."  (The page contains solutions, so don't read the orange text if you want to try this yourself.)  This is exactly the kind of puzzle I like; it's fun to think about, reasonably challenging, and requires knowledge of language features combined with creative thinking.</p>
<p>My solution is below, but I'd recommend that you go give this a try yourself before you read on.

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(<a title="The state of Python imaging - Eevee's Livejournal" href="http://eevee.livejournal.com/307299.html" target="_blank">With apologies to Eevee</a>, of whom I am a great fan.)</p>
<p>So, I'm <a title="Social networks and content ownership - mlindgren.ca" href="http://mlindgren.ca/blog/archives/597" target="_blank">working on a photo album app written in Python.</a>  I'm using Python because, well, I love it.  I think it's the perfect language for web development; it's simple and very readable, and ample syntactic sugar and just the right mix of procedural and functional features almost completely eliminate tedious boilerplate.  As a trivial example for those who have never used Python, consider:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">db_tags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">([(</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">tag</span> <span class="ow">in</span>
                <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MetadataTag</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;exif&#39;</span><span class="p">)])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>What I'm doing here is grabbing all of the EXIF tags I know about out of my database with <a title="SQLAlchemy" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" target="_blank">SQLAlchemy</a> (also awesome, by the way), and creating a dictionary which maps each tag's name to the corresponding <acronym title="Object-Relational Mapper">ORM</acronym> object; I can find the ORM object simply with <code>db_tags[tag_name]</code>, which lets me easily and efficiently insert new tag values as I read <acronym title="Exchangeable Image File Format">EXIF</acronym> data from a photo.  This isn't particularly <em>difficult</em> to do in any other language; as I said, it's a trivial example.  But consider how much more verbose the code would be: PHP, which is still the most popular language for web applications despite being an <a title="PHP: A Fractal of Bad Design - Fuzzy Notepad" href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/" target="_blank">incorrigible pile of garbage</a>, doesn't have list comprehensions.  I don't even want to think about how many lines of code this would take in Java; additionally, while I'm unfamiliar with them in general, I suspect Java ORMs require the use of generics to a painful extent (i.e. more than not at all).  In Python it only takes one <acronym title="Source Line Of Code">SLOC</acronym>, without sacrificing any readability.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>
<p>So, Python's pretty great. But like all languages, it does have a few problems. The one I have had the most difficulty with in my current project is that third party library support is somewhat lacking in some important areas; specifically, there aren't many good options for reading and manipulating images. The most popular library seems to be the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a>, PIL. It's easy enough to install and provides a <em>passable</em> set of core features, but doesn't go much beyond that.  For instance, none of the various camera raw formats seem to be supported, which I consider a fairly important feature for my photo album; I'd very much like be able to upload original raws and have the application automatically convert them to JPEGs for me.  Additionally, it doesn't provide much in the way of convenience methods for cropping and resizing images.  <a title="ImageMagick" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a> has <a title="ImageMagick geometry" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry" target="_blank">a very nice means of specifying cropping and resizing geometry</a> with various aspect ratio-preserving (or not) behaviour, and I wanted to be able to leverage something similar for my app so that I could quickly prototype with various size options.

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Online passes are becoming more and more ubiquitous in the games industry.  For those who aren't familiar with the terminology, an online pass is essentially a form of digital rights management designed to discourage and devalue used game sales by tying some game content to unique, one-use codes packaged with new copies of games.  Online passes are a contentious issue.  Some feel that they're a perfectly legitimate way for developers and publishers to ensure that they get their cut of each sale, and to reward those who purchase games new.  Others see them as a violation of consumer rights or contend that they inconvenience customers who <em>do</em> buy new (by requiring them to type in long access codes on game controllers) while being of only dubious value to publishers and developers.</p>
<p>Most recently, there's been a bit of an uproar over the inclusion of an online pass in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdoms_of_Amalur:_Reckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a></em>, a single-player RPG with no online component.  The pass confers seven extra quests on those who purchase the game new, or deprives those who purchased used of them, depending on your perspective.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you'll forgive me for "metablogging," I've been ruminating lately on the purpose of this website.  Up until now, I've been trying to focus exclusively on technology, programming and game design, and to minimize the subjective aspects of my connection to those fields.  Put more simply, I've been avoiding writing about who I am and what I do in favour of producing a series of mostly impersonal tutorials and critiques of technology.  There are a number of reasons for this—the word "professionalism" comes to mind as chief among them.  I'd like this website to be my public face on the Internet, and as every saavy Internet denizen should know by now, there are certain risks associated with maintaining a public persona.  I greatly admire <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a>, for his personality as well as his technical accomplishments, but I have no desire to make myself unemployable as he claims to have done (albeit temporarily).</p>
<p>That said, trying to take a dry, detached and objective approach to creating a personal website presents a number of problems itself.  First and foremost, it's an inherent contradiction; if I don't write about myself in any meaningful capacity, then there is nothing aside from the superficial about this website which makes it mine.  I can't imagine it makes for a very interesting read, either.  Realistically, how many people will come here looking for <a title="How to link GLUT in Qt Creator on OS X" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/453">advice on how to link GLUT?</a>  Readership numbers are of little to no concern to me, mind you, but I can at least endeavour to give this website a purposeful existence.  To that end, I want to start writing more about personal topics, although for the sake of cohesiveness I'm going to continue to focus primarily on those aspects of my life that will be of interest to a technically-minded audience.</div>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across a couple excellent articles on Gamasutra which I want to share here. The first, "<a title="Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111018/8685/Contrivance_and_Extortion_InApp_Purchases__Microtransactions.php">Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions</a>" is by <a href="http://adamatomic.com/" target="_blank">Adam Saltsman</a>, creator of Canabalt, among other games. He argues that in-app purchases and so-called microtransactions are being abused by some game developers, "deliberately contriving their designs in the worst way in order to extort money from players, which is unethical and unacceptable design practice." I'll lay my cards on the table and say that I am in complete agreement with Adam.  As he does in his <a title="Contrivance and Extortion II: Clarifications, Feedback &amp; Suggestions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111020/8703/Contrivance_and_Extortion_II_Clarifications_Feedback__Suggestions.php">explanatory follow-up</a>, I acknowledge that there are benefits to the "freemium" model, but the techniques commonly associated with that model are often used in a cynical, manipulative and profit-driven manner which I feel is harmful to consumers and the industry. Whether or not you agree, Adam's thoughts on the subject are certainly worth reading.</p>
<p>"<a title="Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EvanJones/20110815/8195/Radical_Plagiarism_The_Ethical_Lessons_of_the_Gamenauts_Controversy.php" target="_blank">Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy</a>," by <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/author/EvanJones/4235/">Evan Jones</a>, is equally thought-provoking. Evan recounts the cloning of the indie game <a href="http://www.bored.com/game/play/150995/Radical_Fishing.html"><em>Radical Fishing</em></a> by the more established indie studio <a href="http://gamenauts.com/">Gamenauts</a>, and adds his perspective on the cultural impact of the rampant cloning that takes place on mobile app stores. Returning readers may recall that I've previously <a title="In Defense of Clones" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/318">defended the practice of cloning games</a>. My defense excluded the cloning of smaller titles by established studios, which I've always viewed as morally questionable at best, but Evan's article nevertheless gave me pause. He provides a strong counterpoint to my own thinking on the matter, and while I'm not yet ready to reverse my position, his argument has undeniable weight. If you're at all interested in game development, both articles are well worth your time.</p></div>

        <a href="/entry/2011/09/21/how-to-link-glut-in-qt-creator-on-os-x/">How to link GLUT in Qt Creator on OS X</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tutorial is for an extremely specific and possibly unusual set of circumstances, but I'm hoping that it will prove useful to someone. For one of my courses this term, we're building OpenGL apps using Nokia's open source Qt framework. Qt provides some very nice scaffolding, and the Qt Creator IDE is among the best I've used, although I imagine it lacks flexibility for general-purpose applications—that is, you probably wouldn't use it to build non-Qt applications. Qt also allows one to easily write cross-platform C++ GUI applications. That said, linking procedures can be a bit different on different platforms, and as a beginner it's not always immediately obvious how instructions for Windows development translate into other environments.</p>
<p>In particular, I found myself having difficulty linking the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) with my project on Mac OS X. After much Googling and some frustration, I came up with the correct way to go about it, which is as follows:
<ol>
    <li>In Qt Creator, open your project file (.pro) in the text editor.  Right click on the text editor pane and select "Add Library..."</li>
    <li>Chose "System Library."</li>
    <li>Locate the GLUT framework.  On my Mac, running Lion, I used <code>/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework</code>. However, it seems there are multiple different copies on the disk that you could use.  If that path doesn't work for you, just search for <code>glut.h</code> in Finder and you'll find a copy of the framework.  The path you enter into Qt Creator should point to a <code>.framework</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Qt Creator will generate code in your project file which will link to the correct framework or library depending on which platform the code is being compiled on.</li>
    <li>Finally, because Apple loves to be different, the glut.h header path is different on OS X.  <strong>You'll need to <code>#include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;</code></strong>, instead of <code>&lt;gl/glut.h&gt;</code> is usually the case.  You can use preprocessor conditional statements to make this inclusion cross-platform:
<pre>#if defined(<strong>APPLE</strong>) || defined(MACOSX)
  #include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;</p>
<h1>else</h1>
<p>#include &lt;gl/glut.h&gt;</p>
<h1>endif</pre></h1>
<p></li>
</ol>
That's it! If you have any trouble, leave a comment.</p></div>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My internship recently ended, and as such, I had to move from Calgary back to Edmonton, where I'll be completing the fourth year of my Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta. I hope to be able to write more about my internship later, but at the moment I want to share a handy trick I discovered for reinstalling OS X. The reason I bring up the move is that after I arrived in Edmonton, I found myself wanting to reformat my Mac Mini and re-install Snow Leopard, but my Snow Leopard disc was nowhere to be found. Luckily, as a semi-paranoid computer scientist with an abundance of disk space, I keep images of important discs on my network-attached storage device for just such occasions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the Snow Leopard disc image is large enough that it can only be burned to a dual-layer DVD. I don't tend to keep writeable dual-layer DVDs lying around, so I needed a solution which required only the disc image itself. There are a number of methods available for installing OS X over the network, but none of them seemed to work for me—perhaps owing to the fact that I had only one Mac. Luckily, I discovered that you can install OS X from a separate partition on the same disk. Here's how:
<ol>
    <li>First, you'll need to re-partition your disk. Open Disk Utility and select the disk you want to use. Be sure to select the disk itself, rather than one of its partitions, which are indented beneath the disk.</li>
    <li>Click the + button to add a new partition, and drag the new partition's section in the disk layout graph upwards until it's large enough to store your operating system disc image. Apply the changes. It may take some time for the disk to be re-partitioned.</li>
    <li>Now, select the new partition from the list on the left. Go to the Restore tab, and restore your operating system disc image to the new partition.</li>
    <li>Once the restore is complete, restart your computer, holding Option (Alt) at start-up. This should bring up a list of available start-up disks. Choose your new partition.</li>
    <li>You should now be at the installer, and you can re-install to your primary partition. Once the installation is complete, delete your installation disc partition to and resize the primary partition to reclaim the extra space.</li>
</ol>
That's it! In retrospect, it's completely obvious, but I haven't seen these instructions anywhere else on the web. This technique might be particularly useful for owners of Macs without disc drives.</p></div>
