</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a discussion today about what lambda functions are used for, how they differ from regular functions, and why they're important. I thought I'd reproduce it here, as it seems that lambdas are often thought of as confusing and obscure. The truth is that they're very simple, and also quite powerful. While they can reduce readability if used incorrectly, they do serve an important purpose, and those who understand them should have nothing to fear from them. This discussion pertains specifically to lambda functions as they're implemented in Python, but they're very similar in other languages where they're available.</div>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In September of last year I ditched my iPhone 3G and switched to the Android-powered HTC Desire (which I later sold in order to purchase a Desire Z, which sports a physical keyboard.)  I'm sad to report that I'm now considering switching back to iOS, after less than a year on the Android platform.  The following is an excerpt from an e-mail I wrote to a friend of mine whom I'd describe as a fervent Android evangelist, detailing some of the frustrations I have with the operating system and why I feel that I might be better served by iOS.  I've edited it slightly to make it more readable for anyone who might come across this blog.</em></p>

<p><em>I really want to like the Android platform, and writing this gave me no joy.  There are two reasons I'm posting it here, though.  The first is simply that the purpose of this website is for me to post about my programming and my experiences with technology (as well as whatever else catches my fancy.)  The second is that I hope that sharing my honest opinion about Android might be helpful to anyone considering a phone purchase.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The week before last, whilst browsing <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> I came across a blog by the name of <a href="http://android-gripes.tumblr.com/">"Android Gripes."</a> The name is perhaps a bit misleading, as it's not actually a blog by an Android user hoping to spur Google into making UI improvements, as I would have expected.  It is, rather, a blog by a self-proclaimed Apple fanboy (though he's recently <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/glbjz/android_gripes_why_do_apps_from_the_same_company/c1ogv3q">edited his about page to remove that admission</a>) complaining about Android for the sake of... well, complaining about Android.</div>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I've finally started doing some Android development in earnest, and because I have a stubborn dislike of Java, I've decided to use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html">Native Development Kit</a>.  The native development kit allows you to write "performance-critical" parts of your application in C or C++ code, which is then compiled to platform-native ARM or MIPS instructions.  The NDK is something of an unfriendly beast; it makes interaction with most regular Android libraries very difficult, and debugging native code on Android is none too easy.  Although Google provides a script which can attach gdb to your native code, I've not yet figured out how to use it properly; every time I execute it, gdb complains about missing debugging symbols and libraries and seems to be unable to do anything useful.  (I don't imagine it's too difficult, but I haven't spent much time on it—I've not needed to do much debugging yet.)</div>

I would urge anyone considering a career in computer science to read it. Given
its brevity (and the fact the title is reasonably descriptive), I won't bother
summarizing the article—instead, I'll merely say that you should click the link

        <a href="/entry/2010/10/03/194/">Making Samba shares accessible to Apache on OS X</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a small weekend project, I've been working on a simple Python HTTP "file server" of sorts.  The basic idea is that authorized users can log in to a web interface and browse files in specific locations on my home network.  The Python script is accessed through Apache on my Mac Mini, but some of the files I need access to are on Windows boxes.  Unfortunately this presented something of a problem, as the Apache user on OS X (<code>_www</code> as of Snow Leopard) doesn't have permission to access Windows shares mounted by users.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right?  Just <code>chmod</code> or <code>chown</code> the Windows share and go to town.  Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work; neither <code>chown</code> or <code>chmod</code> have any effect on mounted Windows shares.  Oddly, they don't output any errors; they just don't <em>do anything.</em> The only way around this seems to be to mount the shares <em>as</em> the Apache user (or whichever user you need to have access).  Here's how to do so in Snow Leopard, with instructions modified slightly from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> <a title="Stack Overflow: mount a windows smb share on OS X as so it can be accessed by 'www' user" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/324171/mount-a-windows-smb-share-on-os-x-as-so-it-can-be-accessed-by-www-user" target="_blank">question on the subject</a>:
<ol>
    <li>Create the mountpoint<br />
        <code>mkdir /Volumes/Mount_Name</code></li>
    <li>Set the permissions on the mount point
<pre><code>sudo chown _www:_www /Volumes/Mount_Name
sudo chmod 755 /Volumes/Mount_Name
</code></pre>
</li>
    <li>If necessary, make a symlink from your Apache documents folder to the mount point<br />
         <code>ln -s /Volumes/Mount_Name /Library/WebServer/Documents/Mount_Name</code></li>
    <li>Mount the share <strong>as the Apache user</strong><br />
        <code>sudo -u _www mount_smbfs //DOMAIN;User:Password@Host/Share /Volumes/Mount_Name</code></li>
</ol></p>
<p>I doubt a great number of people will need this information as it's a strange sort of setup, but it's my hope that these instructions will save someone some time.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent part of last night setting up my HTC Desire as a development device on my Ubuntu laptop.  This was a somewhat frustrating process, because a lot of the information I came across seem to be outdated and didn't work for me.  Even the <a title="Android documentation for developing on a device" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html">official documentation</a> refers to a version of Ubuntu which is more than two years old.  I did eventually piece together the correct process for Ubuntu 10.04, so I'm documenting that process here in the hope that it will help out other developers in the future.  This guide assumes that you've already installed and configured the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK.</a></div>

</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like a number of disgruntled users and developers, I recently decided to trade my iPhone in for an Android device.  My distaste for Apple's app store policies, design philosophy and corporate culture had been pushing me in that direction for some time.  The final straw, though, was iOS 4, which rendered my iPhone 3G almost unusably slow while failing to grant <em>any </em>of the most noteworthy<a title="new features." href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/ios4/" target="_blank"> new features.</a> The <a title="My iPhone Debacle" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/79">inordinate difficulty</a> of downgrading iOS exacerbates the problem for users who are still stuck with the iPhone 3G.  To be fair to Apple, Wednesday will see iOS 4.1 released, and they've claimed that it will fix the iPhone 3G performance issues.  For me, though, 4.1 is too little, too late.</div>

</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It's common knowledge that enrollment in computer science programs has declined significantly over the past decade.  Although the trend seems to be reversing itself with enrollment <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/computer-science-enrollment-continues-growth-but-phds-down.ars">increasing over the past few years</a>, computer science educators shouldn't get complacent just yet.  There's still much work to be done in order to ensure that computer science departments continue to grow and are able to meet the increasing demand for technically skilled graduates.</p>
<p>I've always felt that a lack of exposure is one of the primary detriments to computer science enrollment.  While I don't have any hard data, my own experience combined with an informal surveyal of friends and colleagues leads me to believe that a large percentage of North American high schools—possibly even a majority—offer little in the way of comprehensive computing classes.  While I don't dispute the importance of math, English and science, I can't help but wonder why computing isn't given an equal footing in the educational sphere, given its ubiquity today.</p>
<p>I've encountered a great number of intelligent and educated people who have <em>no idea whatsoever</em> about what the field of computer science is, or even how computers and software work.  I understand that most people don't necessarily need that information.  However, it's odd to me that basic computer literacy isn't required of college graduates (let alone high school students) in the same way that basic writing and math skills are.  In the interest of meeting ever-increasing economic demand for technically skilled graduates, shouldn't we do more to expose students to computing?</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm currently reading <a title="Coders at Work" href="http://www.codersatwork.com/">Coders at Work</a> by Peter Seibel.  The book is a collection of interviews with respected and knowledgeable programmers.  While the interview format can be somewhat difficult to read at times, the book is excellent.  Seibel is himself an experienced programmer, and asks the sort of insightful questions no ordinary interviewer could, making for fascinating discussions.  One could mine the book for weeks for interesting quotes.  I'm going to try to resist that temptation, but because it relates to the topic at hand, I will permit myself to share with you one statement made by Joe Armstrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being a young programmer today must be awful—you can choose 20 different programming languages, dozens of framework[s] and operating systems and you're paralysed by choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Armstrong is mistaken; it's anything but awful to be a young programmer today.  However, it's certainly true that the number of choices one must make in starting a project can be daunting.  The choices you make at the start of a project can have far-reaching implications.  Choose wisely and your endeavour might be easy and successful, but choose poorly and you'll almost certainly regret it later.  For iPhone game developers, perhaps the most important choice that must be made early on in a project is which graphics libraries to use.</div>
