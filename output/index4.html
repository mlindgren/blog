  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tutorial is for an extremely specific and possibly unusual set of circumstances, but I'm hoping that it will prove useful to someone. For one of my courses this term, we're building OpenGL apps using Nokia's open source Qt framework. Qt provides some very nice scaffolding, and the Qt Creator IDE is among the best I've used, although I imagine it lacks flexibility for general-purpose applications—that is, you probably wouldn't use it to build non-Qt applications. Qt also allows one to easily write cross-platform C++ GUI applications. That said, linking procedures can be a bit different on different platforms, and as a beginner it's not always immediately obvious how instructions for Windows development translate into other environments.</p>
<p>In particular, I found myself having difficulty linking the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) with my project on Mac OS X. After much Googling and some frustration, I came up with the correct way to go about it, which is as follows:
<ol>
    <li>In Qt Creator, open your project file (.pro) in the text editor.  Right click on the text editor pane and select "Add Library..."</li>
    <li>Chose "System Library."</li>
    <li>Locate the GLUT framework.  On my Mac, running Lion, I used <code>/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework</code>. However, it seems there are multiple different copies on the disk that you could use.  If that path doesn't work for you, just search for <code>glut.h</code> in Finder and you'll find a copy of the framework.  The path you enter into Qt Creator should point to a <code>.framework</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Qt Creator will generate code in your project file which will link to the correct framework or library depending on which platform the code is being compiled on.</li>
    <li>Finally, because Apple loves to be different, the glut.h header path is different on OS X.  <strong>You'll need to <code>#include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;</code></strong>, instead of <code>&lt;gl/glut.h&gt;</code> is usually the case.  You can use preprocessor conditional statements to make this inclusion cross-platform:
<pre>#if defined(<strong>APPLE</strong>) || defined(MACOSX)
  #include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;</p>
<h1>else</h1>
<p>#include &lt;gl/glut.h&gt;</p>
<h1>endif</pre></h1>
<p></li>
</ol>
That's it! If you have any trouble, leave a comment.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My internship recently ended, and as such, I had to move from Calgary back to Edmonton, where I'll be completing the fourth year of my Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta. I hope to be able to write more about my internship later, but at the moment I want to share a handy trick I discovered for reinstalling OS X. The reason I bring up the move is that after I arrived in Edmonton, I found myself wanting to reformat my Mac Mini and re-install Snow Leopard, but my Snow Leopard disc was nowhere to be found. Luckily, as a semi-paranoid computer scientist with an abundance of disk space, I keep images of important discs on my network-attached storage device for just such occasions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the Snow Leopard disc image is large enough that it can only be burned to a dual-layer DVD. I don't tend to keep writeable dual-layer DVDs lying around, so I needed a solution which required only the disc image itself. There are a number of methods available for installing OS X over the network, but none of them seemed to work for me—perhaps owing to the fact that I had only one Mac. Luckily, I discovered that you can install OS X from a separate partition on the same disk. Here's how:
<ol>
    <li>First, you'll need to re-partition your disk. Open Disk Utility and select the disk you want to use. Be sure to select the disk itself, rather than one of its partitions, which are indented beneath the disk.</li>
    <li>Click the + button to add a new partition, and drag the new partition's section in the disk layout graph upwards until it's large enough to store your operating system disc image. Apply the changes. It may take some time for the disk to be re-partitioned.</li>
    <li>Now, select the new partition from the list on the left. Go to the Restore tab, and restore your operating system disc image to the new partition.</li>
    <li>Once the restore is complete, restart your computer, holding Option (Alt) at start-up. This should bring up a list of available start-up disks. Choose your new partition.</li>
    <li>You should now be at the installer, and you can re-install to your primary partition. Once the installation is complete, delete your installation disc partition to and resize the primary partition to reclaim the extra space.</li>
</ol>
That's it! In retrospect, it's completely obvious, but I haven't seen these instructions anywhere else on the web. This technique might be particularly useful for owners of Macs without disc drives.</p></div>

Canada has suffered a terrible loss with the death of Jack Layton, the leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the phenomenal and growing successes of the iPhone App Store, the Android Market, and the Xbox Live Indie Games marketplace, gamers have seen an unprecedented number of titles which could be described as "clones" of more successful games&mdash;or rip-offs, if you're feeling less kind.  Along with these titles has come a veritable tsunami of hatred for their developers, from game critics and anonymous Internet commenters alike.  The commercial success of some of these titles, such as <em>Angry Birds</em>,<sup>1</sup> has shown that average gamers are happy to patronize any developer who can provide a fun experience, regardless of originality.  However, any mention of a new clone on a gaming blog or podcast inevitably brings about a stunning amount of vitriol from gamers who, presumably, are upset that their favorite megacorporations aren't getting their due.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a discussion today about what lambda functions are used for, how they differ from regular functions, and why they're important. I thought I'd reproduce it here, as it seems that lambdas are often thought of as confusing and obscure. The truth is that they're very simple, and also quite powerful. While they can reduce readability if used incorrectly, they do serve an important purpose, and those who understand them should have nothing to fear from them. This discussion pertains specifically to lambda functions as they're implemented in Python, but they're very similar in other languages where they're available.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In September of last year I ditched my iPhone 3G and switched to the Android-powered HTC Desire (which I later sold in order to purchase a Desire Z, which sports a physical keyboard.)  I'm sad to report that I'm now considering switching back to iOS, after less than a year on the Android platform.  The following is an excerpt from an e-mail I wrote to a friend of mine whom I'd describe as a fervent Android evangelist, detailing some of the frustrations I have with the operating system and why I feel that I might be better served by iOS.  I've edited it slightly to make it more readable for anyone who might come across this blog.</em></p>

<p><em>I really want to like the Android platform, and writing this gave me no joy.  There are two reasons I'm posting it here, though.  The first is simply that the purpose of this website is for me to post about my programming and my experiences with technology (as well as whatever else catches my fancy.)  The second is that I hope that sharing my honest opinion about Android might be helpful to anyone considering a phone purchase.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I've finally started doing some Android development in earnest, and because I have a stubborn dislike of Java, I've decided to use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html">Native Development Kit</a>.  The native development kit allows you to write "performance-critical" parts of your application in C or C++ code, which is then compiled to platform-native ARM or MIPS instructions.  The NDK is something of an unfriendly beast; it makes interaction with most regular Android libraries very difficult, and debugging native code on Android is none too easy.  Although Google provides a script which can attach gdb to your native code, I've not yet figured out how to use it properly; every time I execute it, gdb complains about missing debugging symbols and libraries and seems to be unable to do anything useful.  (I don't imagine it's too difficult, but I haven't spent much time on it—I've not needed to do much debugging yet.)</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a small weekend project, I've been working on a simple Python HTTP "file server" of sorts.  The basic idea is that authorized users can log in to a web interface and browse files in specific locations on my home network.  The Python script is accessed through Apache on my Mac Mini, but some of the files I need access to are on Windows boxes.  Unfortunately this presented something of a problem, as the Apache user on OS X (<code>_www</code> as of Snow Leopard) doesn't have permission to access Windows shares mounted by users.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right?  Just <code>chmod</code> or <code>chown</code> the Windows share and go to town.  Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work; neither <code>chown</code> or <code>chmod</code> have any effect on mounted Windows shares.  Oddly, they don't output any errors; they just don't <em>do anything.</em> The only way around this seems to be to mount the shares <em>as</em> the Apache user (or whichever user you need to have access).  Here's how to do so in Snow Leopard, with instructions modified slightly from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> <a title="Stack Overflow: mount a windows smb share on OS X as so it can be accessed by 'www' user" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/324171/mount-a-windows-smb-share-on-os-x-as-so-it-can-be-accessed-by-www-user" target="_blank">question on the subject</a>:
<ol>
    <li>Create the mountpoint<br />
        <code>mkdir /Volumes/Mount_Name</code></li>
    <li>Set the permissions on the mount point
<pre><code>sudo chown _www:_www /Volumes/Mount_Name
sudo chmod 755 /Volumes/Mount_Name
</code></pre>
</li>
    <li>If necessary, make a symlink from your Apache documents folder to the mount point<br />
         <code>ln -s /Volumes/Mount_Name /Library/WebServer/Documents/Mount_Name</code></li>
    <li>Mount the share <strong>as the Apache user</strong><br />
        <code>sudo -u _www mount_smbfs //DOMAIN;User:Password@Host/Share /Volumes/Mount_Name</code></li>
</ol>
I doubt a great number of people will need this information as it's a strange sort of setup, but it's my hope that these instructions will save someone some time.</p></div>
