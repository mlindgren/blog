        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/12/27/early-access-roundup/">Steam Early Access Roundup</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I'm previewing three early access titles now available on Steam:
<em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/369200">Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online</a></em>,
<em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/">Rust</a></em>, and
<em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/393420">Hurtworld</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online</h3>
<p>...Tactical Combat Video Game Entertainment Simulation System. Okay, I made that
last part up, but somebody in Nexon America's marketing department really should
have reigned in that title a little bit. It can't even be made into a convenient
acronym. "Hey, want to play GITSSACFAO?" asked no one, ever.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I was drawn to this title because I love <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex">
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> (as well as the <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_%28film%29">
Ghost in the Shell</a></em> films). If you're not
familiar with the series, it follows a special forces team led by Major Motoko
Kusanagi in a sci-fi 2030s Japan where everyone who can afford it is a cyborg.
(The overoptimistic timeline is worthy of <em>Back to the Future</em>!) The setting is
leveraged to deliver some surprisingly sophisticated philosophical and social
commentary&mdash;for an anime, anyway. But more to the point, there's also a lot
of over-the-top action and a hint of gun-fetishism, which makes the series
perfect for a first person shooter. It's surprising, then, that nobody has tried
to make one until now.</p>
<p><a href="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits1.jpg"><img alt="Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Whatever
Online" src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits1_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the results are mixed, at least at this early stage. I've seen
some significant stuttering during some matches, which is a real problem in such
a fast-paced shooter. The gunplay also is also ever-so-slightly off. It's got a
satisfying, weighty feel to it, but I can't quite get used to the aiming and
recoil. Adjusting your aim while looking down the sights is so incredibly slow
compared to the pace of player movement that the best strategy seems to be to
just never use iron sights at all except at extreme range. It feels like they're
taking cues from <em>Counter-Strike</em>, but they haven't quite nailed the experience
yet.</p>
<p>I trust that some of these issues will be fixed as the game is developed
further, but what's more worrying is the character progression mechanic.
Although early access to the game costs money, this is pretty clearly intended
to be a free-to-play game, and as such there are already a plethora of
unlockable weapon and ability upgrades. There are so many different things to
customize that it's almost overwhelming at first. That would be a good thing if
not for the fact that the pace of unlocks seems very slow (as if to encourage
people to spend real money—imagine that!), and the unlockables don't seem very
balanced. A fully upgraded character has clear advantages over a new character,
which leads to a frustrating sense of unfairness.</p>
<p><a href="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits2.jpg"><img alt="Remember when games had
gibs?" src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits2_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think this one is worth keeping an eye on, but I don't see it becoming my
go-to shooter unless I end up being dead wrong about the free-to-play
monetization scheme.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>[I completed this review after playing</em> Fallout 4 <em>for a total of 25 hours. I
completed the main quest line during my play through.]</em></p>
<p><em>Fallout 4</em> is the latest in Bethesda's revival of Black Isle Studios' beloved
post-apocalyptic role playing series, and like its predecessors it has met with
much praise and market success. But I find myself unable to quite grasp the
popularity of the game, because also like its predecessors, <em>Fallout 4</em>'s
impressive scale and ambitious design are hamstrung by some major flaws in the
execution.</div>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I keep forgetting to mention it, but this May was the fifth anniversary of
this blog. Thus, it's time again for some housekeeping.
<a href="/entry/2012/09/23/switching-to-octopress/">Three years ago</a> I stopped using
Wordpress for my blog and moved it to <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>.
Octopress is a great blogging framework, but its current incarnation
<a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">has some major shortcomings</a>.
Those will be fixed with Octopress 3.0, but 3.0 has been a long time coming, and
due to the changing distribution model the work to move from 2.0 to 3.0 may be
substantial. Plus, Octopress isn't the best fit for me because it's written in
Ruby, which I don't know and don't have much interest in learning; I much prefer
Python.</p>
<p>I recently learned of <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>, which is a
Python-based blogging tool. Luckily, Maurizio Sambati has already done the hard
work of
<a href="https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme">porting the Octopress theme to Pelican</a>.
Since my blog's theme is the Octopress theme with a few tweaks, it wasn't an
inordinate amount of work to
<a href="https://github.com/mlindgren/mlindgren-pelican-theme">port my own theme to Pelican</a>.
Jake Vanderplas also did some great work in
<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/pull/21">porting some of Octopress' Liquid tags</a>
to Pelican, and he also has
<a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/">a great blog post</a>
which walks through the process (and describes some of his reasons for
switching, which mirror my own). In the end, it did take me several hours of
work to move everything over and clean up some of the posts where I was making
use of various Octopress plug-ins, but I think it will be a boon in the long
run. (Please let me know if anything appears to be broken, as it's possible that
I missed something.)</p>
<p>In addition to being easier for me to use and contribute to, I'm really excited
about Pelican's support for tags. Tagging will help organize my blog,
especially since I've limited myself to having only a few categories since I'm
committed to having a unique, easily-distinguishable color for each one. I'm
also excited that Pelican has built-in support for
<a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html#translations">translating articles</a>,
which I plan to take advantage of to practice the languages I'm learning.</p>
<p>Check back in three years to see which new blogging platform I switch to next!</p></div>

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/09/25/tv-series-review-mr-robot/">TV Series Review: Mr. Robot, Season One</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don't watch a whole lot of TV. In fact, I don't even have cable. The only
shows I end up watching, therefore, are those I'm introduced to or I read about.
<em>Mr. Robot</em> is the latest such show; I read
<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/06/mr_robot_on_usa_finally_hollywood_created_a_realistic_hacker_character.html">David Auerbach's piece on it</a>
and was intrigued. In Auerbach's words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Real misfits&mdash;disturbing, unappealing, unlovable misfits&mdash;make for
poor Hollywood protagonists. It takes some faith to inject a genuinely
alienating hero into a film or TV show. But ever since the broader world of
tech has gained a whiff of cool over the past decade or so, Hollywood's
portrayals of hackers, programmers, and other screen-strapped geeks have
tended to sugarcoat the frequently unvarnished and even unappealing aspects of
a culture that prides itself on not caring about the mainstream. I'm not
bemoaning the lack of shy nerds with hearts of gold here, but of awkward and
even abrasive characters who talk too loudly, can't follow conversational
cues, transgress boundaries obliviously, and harbor conspiracy theories or
other unappealing ideas&mdash;like a lot of actual hackers out there. We
forget that people detest savant types for reasons beyond their smarts, and a
lack of social graces is one of them.</p>
<p>Elliot, the protagonist of the new USA Network drama <em>Mr. Robot</em>, comes far
closer to this type than an American television show has dared for a while.
(Elliot isn't the titular Mr. Robot&mdash;that's Christian Slater.) As played
by Rami Malek, Elliot doesn't have the charisma of Benedict Cumberbatch's
Sherlock or the anti-charisma of Hugh Laurie's Dr. House. Unlike Tony
Shalhoub's Adrian Monk, he's not a collection of quivering nerves and
endearing eccentricities. These characters&mdash;all nerds of one sort or
another&mdash;are fundamentally capable of functioning in society, and Elliot
really isn't. He and the world just don't hook up in the right way. Taking
copious drugs in order to function, he carries a vacant and flattened affect,
neither making eye contact with anyone nor turning away when they look at him.
With his emaciated face and sunken eyes, Malek gives an impression of
emptiness, paranoia, and above all disconnection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably a polarizing description: some people will be immediately
interested while others will probably question why anyone would want to watch
it. It was very much the former for me, possibly because Auerbach's description
of Elliot hits a bit close to home. I watched the first episode and was
instantly hooked. The show immediately draws you into its world: a sort of
dystopian present, a mirror image of our own reality, but viewed through the
eyes of a brilliant, cynical, emotionally troubled young man who struggles not
only with an unfeeling universe but also with drug addiction and mental
illness.</p>
<p>Atypically for movies and TV, Elliot's mental illness is depicted  respectfully
and at least somewhat accurately, too. He's not an over-the-top Hollywood
psycho, but merely a vulnerable person suffering from paranoia and delusions.
And being a software developer, I also really appreciated that the show nails
the technology.  It's not <em>completely</em> realistic, but that's to be expected; the
reality of programming and hacking is that they're slow, analytical processes,
often consisting of long stretches of thought punctuated by short bursts of
activity.  In other words, they're boring to watch, and sometimes to undertake,
too.  <em>Mr. Robot</em> strips that away, but it keeps the interesting aspects intact
without insulting the audience's intelligence with impossible technology,
meaningless invented jargon, or awful 3D
<acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>s.</p>

</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Some of this post is adapted from a Facebook comment I wrote earlier in the year in response to
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/farewell-america-canada-could-learn-a-few-things-from-you-1.3143760">this CBC article</a>.
Many of the statements in this post are conjecture based on my own experiences and perceptions; I do
not claim that everything in it is broadly applicable.</em></p>
<p>May of 2015 marked the beginning of my fourth year in the United States. Now that I have a green
card and don't have to worry quite as much about saying the wrong thing and getting kicked out of
the country, I wanted to take the opportunity to discuss what it's like to live here from my
perspective. I was going to write "from a Canadian perspective," but of course, I don't speak for
all Canadian immigrants.</p>
<p>Before I started my career, I had never really planned to come to the US. I was only part of the way
through my senior year at the University of Alberta when I happened upon a Microsoft recruiting
booth at a career fair. Microsoft was the only real technology company present; most of the others
were oil and gas companies, that being what Alberta's economy is primarily based on. I left a resume
with them, not really expecting much to come of it.</p>
<p>As it turned out, I did get a call back (which I almost missed&mdash;funny how such small events can
result in drastic changes in one's life). A few weeks and several highly stressful interviews later,
I had signed a job offer. Shortly after I graduated, my wife and I were on a plane to Seattle. Even
at that point, I didn't really expect to live in the States for more than a year or so. My goal was
primarily to get a "marquee company" on my resume (a piece of advice a friend and former colleague
gave me) and then use that as a bargaining chip to get a better job back home. But now it's been more
than three years, and not only am I still here, but I no longer have plans to leave in the
foreseeable future.</div>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Windows 10 is out today! This is the first release of Windows that I have worked
on as a developer , and I'm proud of what my team and Microsoft as a whole have
accomplished in the past year-and-a-half or so. Several tech websites have
already posted reviews, and so far the trend is very positive. A colleague of
mine posted some excerpts, which I'm going to borrow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows 10 represents the obvious future of PC operating systems. It makes Mac OS X feel old-fashioned, stuck in a time where The Desktop was a thing that mattered and the only way to access the Internet was through a browser.</p>

David Pierce <cite><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/windows-10-review/">Wired</a></cite>

<blockquote>
<p>So the question finally presents itself: should you upgrade your machine to Windows 10? Yes, you should.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are on a PC at all, Windows 10 is where you want to go. That it is free&mdash;for now&mdash;only makes the point simpler.</p>

<p>If you haven't already done so, you can follow the instructions
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade">here</a> to get your
free upgrade.  It's very exciting to have played a role in the creation of the
latest and truly greatest version of Windows; I think this is a huge
achievement for Microsoft, and I'm happy to have been a part of it. The real
reward, though, is seeing people use and enjoy Windows 10&mdash;and that starts
today!</p></div>

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/05/22/game-review-bloodborne/">Game Review: Bloodborne</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>[I completed this review after playing Bloodborne for approximately 30 hours. I have finished the
game, but I have not discovered 100% of the content. I played the entire game solo, not using any
summons to help with boss fights. I have not yet participated in any PvP.]</em></p>
<p><em>Bloodborne</em> is the spiritual successor to From Software's <em>Demons Souls</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> series,
and its pedigree is clear right out of the gate. Upon starting the game, you'll enter the character
creation menu and be asked to choose from a number of classes with different stats, but will be
given almost no explanation of what the stats mean or how they affect gameplay. If you're a <em>Dark
Souls</em> veteran, you can make some educated guesses, but new players will be completely on their own.
After a short introductory sequence, you're thrown into an open world replete with buildings of
impossible scale, which stretches vast, seemingly endless distances in each direction. You're
completely on your own to make your path through this world, and there's no obvious "correct" route;
in fact, a friend and I found different bosses first, because we had taken different routes from the
start.</p>
<p>If this experience sounds like it might be frustrating for new players, that's because it absolutely
can be. Even for veterans of the series, the complete lack of guidance can feel punishing at times.
And yet, I can't stress how much I absolutely love it. The freedom not only to explore, but to truly
discover the workings of the world, and to make mistakes, is what made the <em>Souls</em> series what it
was, and <em>Bloodborne</em> continues this legacy. The game pays homage to times past, when games didn't
hold the player's hand throughout the entire experience, and it does so with such expertise and
craftsmanship that none of its contemporaries can compare.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors, <em>Bloodborne</em> adeptly balances challenging and sometimes frustrating gameplay
with frequent rewards and other powerful motivators: the prospect of discovering something new, of
overcoming the next challenging boss, of finding the next area, or of glimpsing another thread of
the world's deep backstory. These enticements work so well because of the depth and imagination with
which the world is crafted. There's a constant sense of cataclysmic urgency, but you won't truly
understand it until you take the time to piece together all of the subtle clues placed throughout
the world. <em>Bloodborne</em> gives you very little to go on, but it trusts you to have the fortitude and
curiosity to work things out for yourself.</div>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of exciting news today! First off, Microsoft has made a couple exciting announcements about
Windows 10. Full disclosure: I am a Microsoft employee, so I am posting these for self-interested
reasons, but I'm also genuinely really excited about what they mean for Windows.</p>
<p>The two new features are called <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/17/making-windows-10-more-personal-and-more-secure-with-windows-hello/">Windows Hello and Microsoft Passport</a>.
Windows Hello is a software feature which, with supported hardware, offers "biometric authentication
which can provide instant access to your Windows 10 devices." But Windows Hello is not just the same
old support for fingerprint readers that Windows has had for many years now; it "enables you to
authenticate applications, enterprise content, and even certain online experiences without a
password being stored on your device or in a network server at all."</p>
<p>To accomplish that, Windows Hello works in conjunction with Microsoft Passport, which enables you to
"securely authenticate to applications, websites and networks [...] without sending up a password.
Thus, there is no shared password stored on their servers for a hacker to potentially compromise."</div>

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/03/14/fun-with-the-microsoft-band-sdk-preview/">Fun with the Microsoft Band SDK Preview</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all, happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day">Pi Day</a>! Using the standard United States
date format, today is 3/14/15, which makes it the most significant Pi Day this century.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've spent the past few hours tinkering with the
<a href="http://developer.microsoftband.com/">Microsoft Band SDK Preview</a>, and although I think it's
unfortunate that there's no SDK for writing apps which actually run on the Band itself, you can
still accomplish some pretty cool things with the phone SDK. Unfortunately, this being a preview
release, the documentation is a bit sparse, and I had some trouble figuring out how to get things
working. Thus, I wanted to share some of what I've learned. If you prefer to dive right into the
code, I've got a small C# sample application <a href="https://github.com/mlindgren/BandDemo">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Standard disclaimer: although I am a Microsoft employee, everything I am posting here and on GitHub
is my own personal work done on my own time. None of it should be considered as officially
representative of Microsoft in any respect. While I will do my best to answer any questions I can
related to the Band SDK Preview, I cannot provide official support for this or any other Microsoft
product.</p>
<p>Let's get started. If you're following
<a href="http://developer.microsoftband.com/docs/MicrosoftBandSDKPreview.pdf">the documentation</a>, the first
few steps describe how to connect to the Band, as one would expect. The sample code provided creates
a connection within a <code>using</code> block. This ensures that the connection is disposed of as soon as
control leaves the block, which is sensible since maintaing a connection to the Band, especially
when subscribed to multiple sensors, can severely impact its battery life. However, this approach
can also be a bit misleading, because if you <em>do</em> want to collect data from the Band over some
interval of time, you will only be able to do so during the lifetime of the <code>IBandClient</code> returned
by <code>ConnectAsync</code>. As soon as the <code>IBandClient</code> is disposed of, your connection will be closed and
you will no longer receive sensor data.</p>
<p>Since you'll typically only be connected to one Band at a time, the easiest way to solve this
problem is to store the <code>IBandClient</code> as a static member variable of your <code>Application</code> class.
(Note: I don't guarantee that this is the <em>optimal</em> solution. I am by no means an expert here.) This
also makes it easy to access your Band client from different pages within your application, and to
unsubscribe from sensor data when you no longer need it so that you won't drain the Band's
battery.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I've been working on my next book review for a few days now, but I'm finding
that when I try to work on it, words don't come quickly or easily to me. So,
what the hell&mdash;might as well try something different. Music is immensely
important to me. I've got a fairly large collection spanning over a thousand
artists in dozens of different genres; I spent two years working in a record
store (back when those still existed) and I consider music crucial to my ability
to handle difficult emotions, be productive, and maintain sanity.</p>
<p>However, I've always been reluctant to write about it, because I'm basically
musically illiterate. I don't play any instruments; I can't tell a C from an F;
I can barely pick out the individual instruments in a song; I don't even know
the right terminology to use when discussing what makes music good or not. I
hope that eventually I'll be able to take some music lessons and correct this to
some extent, because I also believe that you can't fully appreciate something
you don't understand. But for now, I remain ignorant of the intricacies of
musical composition. Thus, I'm not going to be so presumptuous as to call this a
review, but... well, keep reading and you'll see what I'm on about.</p>
<p>I go through periods of obsession with musical artists where I'll discover
someone new and become absolutely, completely captivated by them, usually buying
several if not all of their records and listening to them over and over again
until I've thoroughly "worn out" every single song. Then, if I'm lucky, I find
someone new to become obsessed with, and the cycle begins anew.</p>
<p>Last month it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Del_Rey">Lana Del Rey</a>:
her albums <em>Born to Die</em> and <em>Paradise</em> are absolutely phenomenal, and she
herself is just an incredibly talented artist.  One thing I find particularly
interesting about Lana is how her sound&mdash;her voice, in
particular&mdash;seems to evoke the 1950s; according to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Del_Rey">Wikipedia</a>, "her music has
been noted for its cinematic sound and its references to various aspects of pop
culture, particularly that of 1950s and '60s Americana." But Del Rey's music
doesn't sound dated&mdash;lyrically, she manages to capture a timeless quality
while also epitomizing modernity and the hollowness of American decadence. It's
a combination unlike anything else I have ever heard, and I still find it
almost intoxicating.</p>
<p>Del Rey has announced a fourth album, <em>Honeymoon</em>, which is billed as being more
like <em>Born to Die</em> and <em>Paradise</em> than her third album, <em>Ultraviolence</em>, which I
have to admit that I didn't care for as much. Naturally, I'm really looking
forward to that. Enough about Lana, though. This month, I'm hooked on Taylor
Swift's latest album, <em><a href="http://taylorswift.com/releases#/release/12453">1989</a></em>.
