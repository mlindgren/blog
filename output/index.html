        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2017/11/05/fitbit-ionic-review/">Review: Fitbit Ionic</a>

<p><br /></p>
<p><small>Conflict of interest disclosure: I own about 30 shares of Fitbit stock, which I purchased
halfway through writing this review, on the hope that apparently strong Ionic sales would give the
stock a boost. So far, that hasn't been the case. At any rate, the value of the stock is less than
the cost of the device itself, so I don't think it compromises my objectivity, but you have been
warned.</small></p>
<p>Fitbit recently released their first true smartwatch, the Ionic. After going through a phase of
slight obsession in the lead-up to its release, during which I spent many hours watching preview
videos and reading comparisons between the Ionic, the Apple Watch Series 3, and the Garmin
Vivoactive 3, I ultimately decided to buy the Ionic. I've now had it for about a month, so this
seems like a good time to review the device and discuss what I think it does well, and not so well.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an in-depth review of the Fitbit Ionic with a particular emphasis on how it
performs as a fitness tracker, I'd recommend reading
<a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/09/fitbit-ionic-smartwatch-in-depth-review.html">DC Rainmaker's review</a>.
I'm not that serious an athlete, so I won't be going into depth about the GPS and heart rate
accuracy, and really there's no need for me to do so, since DC Rainmaker has already covered those
aspects of the device. This review is merely my own non-expert opinion of the device based on my own
experience, with a bit more emphasis on the smartwatch features of the Ionic and how suitable the
watch is for various types of users.</p>
<h3>Fitness features</h3>
<p>Even though I don't consider myself a serious athlete, I did buy the Fitbit Ionic primarily as a
fitness tracker, so I'd be remiss to not mention how the device fares in that respect. Indeed, I
think it's fair to say that the Ionic was <em>designed</em> primarily as a fitness tracker, with the
smartwatch functionality being somewhat secondary. In fact, I think some of the comparisons that
other reviewers have made between the Ionic and the Apple Watch are somewhat off base, because they
don't take into account the fact that the devices are designed with different audiences in mind.
Moreover, the Apple Watch is only compatible with iOS devices, so if you don't use iOS, the Apple
Watch is simply not an option. That means that although the Apple Watch is (according to Apple) now
the most popular watch globally, its addressable market is actually only a tiny fraction of the
Ionic's (and other watch manufacturers). Unfortunately for Fitbit, competition in this market is
extremely fierce, even if you only consider all the Android and Windows users that the Apple Watch
can't reach.</p>
<p>So, how does the Ionic perform as a fitness tracker? I think it's pretty good for the most part, but
there are some noteworthy shortcomings that Fitbit absolutely needs to address in future software
updates if they want to stay competitive. But let's start with the good parts. First of all, I've
been impressed with the GPS. It connects quickly and consistently, and in my experience, the
accuracy is pretty good for a wrist-mounted device. I have found that it tends to cut corners if you
make sharp turns, which can result in runs appearing slightly shorter than they actually are, but
the deviation is only about 50-100 meters over a 5km run. This is on par with the accuracy of other
devices, and it won't be cause for concern for most people. Besides, in some cases that error will
be averaged out by other noise.</p>

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got the new <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/ionic">Fitbit Ionic</a> a few weeks ago, and I'm generally pretty
happy with the device. I'm in the process of writing a full review of the Ionic, but I realized
partway through that I had written quite a lot about the SDK, which many people probably won't be
interested in. Hence, I decided to make that into its own post. In the meantime, if you're looking
for a review, I would recommend reading <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/09/fitbit-ionic-smartwatch-in-depth-review.html">DC Rainmaker's</a>.
He's a much more serious athlete than I am, and he reviews fitness gear semi-professionally, so he's
able to put the devices through much more rigorous tests and go into detail about things like heart
rate and GPS accuracy, which I won't be doing.</p>

<a href="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/Ionic.jpg">
<img src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/IonicSmall.jpg" title="The Fitbit Ionic"/>
</a>


<p><br /></p>
<p>Anyway, the Ionic being Fitbit's first real smartwatch, I was eager to check out the SDK and dive
into app development. And, well, I've tried to do so, but so far the results haven't been great. I
think this is partly just because the platform is very new, and partly because of some questionable
technology decisions that Fitbit made. Although it's too early to really evaluate the success or
failure of the Ionic, or of FitOS an app platform, I think it can still be instructive to look at
some of the choices that Fitbit made in designing the device and the OS, what effects they're having
on developers now, and why I think they may prove to have been suboptimal choices.</p>
<p>Battery life was clearly the foremost concern for Fitbit when they designed the Ionic, and the
technology decisions reflect that. Whereas the Apple Watch series 3 has a dual core CPU with a
maximum clock speed of at least 780 Mhz, 3D graphics acceleration, and a
<a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_watch_series_3-8860.php">rumored 768MB of RAM</a>, the Ionic contains
the humble <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/us/product/assp/applite/tz1200.html">Toshiba TZ1201XBG</a>,
with a meager maximum clock speed of 120Mhz<sup id="fnref-cpu"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-cpu">1</a></sup>. The battery life of the two devices reflects
these hardware differences: the Ionic lasts 4-5 days on a charge, whereas the Apple Watch lasts a
maximum of 2 days. Personally, I think this was a great choice by Fitbit.  Although the Apple Watch
is inarguably a more capable "smartwatch," its two-day maximum battery life is an absolute
deal-breaker for me, which is one of the primary reasons I bought the Ionic instead.</p>
<p>With the hardware itself being so thoughtfully designed to maximize battery life, it strikes me as a
bit odd that Fitbit chose JavaScript as the sole language for app development on their platform.
JavaScript is not known for being a high-performance, memory-efficient programming language;
historically, it has been quite the opposite. Of course, it's not the language itself that matters
so much as the interpreter, and modern JavaScript engines like V8 and Chakra have made extremely
significant performance improvements compared to how slow JavaScript interpreters used to
be. The Ionic, for its part, uses an engine called "<a href="http://jerryscript.net/">JerryScript</a>", which
is designed specifically for <acronym title="Internet of Things">IoT</acronym> devices and allows
JavaScript to be precompiled to bytecode; it boasts that it can run in environments with less than
64KB of RAM and less than 200KB of ROM. I'm not sure where the name comes from; contrary to what you
might expect, the project's main contributor does not appear to be named Jerry. For me, the name
just conjures images of <a href="http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Jerry_Smith">Jerry from Rick and Morty</a>:</p>
<video class="video" id="video-jerry" alt="Jerry from Rick and Morty"
height="282" width="502" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" preload="true">
<source src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/Jerry.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Uh, anyway, JavaScript is still orders of magnitude slower than C and C++ for most workloads, and
when you're concerned about energy efficiency and performance on a device with a 120Mhz single-core
CPU, that difference matters. I freely admit that I am biased in favor of languages like C and C++,
which are as close to the metal as you can get in a high-level language. Some would consider this
preference anachronistic, but it's undeniable that there are still many places where maximizing
performance really does matter. Embedded applications are one of those places, and I'm fairly
confident that on the Ionic, using native code could have offered even better battery life, or
perhaps improved performance, which is sometimes suboptimal even in the built-in apps.</p>
<p>Similarly, all UI on the Ionic is done using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG
is a lot easier to use than requiring developers to render their own UI, but it's also a lot less
flexible than just blitting pixels to the screen. The minimum benchmark that any modern computing
device should be able to pass is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/itrunsdoom/">whether or not it can run DOOM</a>,
but between the poor performance of JavaScript and the inflexibility of SVG, I don't see that
happening on the Ionic any time soon.</p>

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2017/10/05/software-development-career-advice/">Computer Science Career Advice</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, a family member of a friend of mine sent me an email asking for advice on pursuing
a career in computer science. I enjoyed answering his questions, and I thought other aspiring
computer scientists might have similar questions, so with his permission, I decided to reproduce my
answers here. I've made a few edits here and there, mostly to remove personal information.</p>
<p>I want to be clear up front that I've only been doing this professional for about six years now, and
I don't consider myself any sort of expert on how to have a successful career. The path I've chosen
has worked out pretty well for me so far, but it's not the right path for everyone, and in an
industry that changes as quickly as this one does, it's always hard to know what students should
focus on when they're still several years from graduation.</p>
<h3>What position do you hold at Microsoft and what is the scope of your work?</h3>
<p>I'm a Software Development Engineer working in Windows OS security. Specifically, my team and I have
spent the last several years working on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-hello">Windows Hello</a>.
We don't do the actual template generation or matching for biometrics (face/fingerprint
authentication), but we own pretty much the whole stack below that, including basically all of the
crypto and some parts of the UI and UX. The marketing for Windows Hello mostly focuses on the
biometric aspect, but the feature is actually a lot more than that.</p>
<p>Under the covers, Windows Hello provides key and/or X509 certificate-based login to domains and
certain web services such as Microsoft accounts. In short, Windows Hello is more secure than using
passwords, and you can get that benefit even if you don't have the hardware to do biometrics or
don't want to use biometrics. We're working with industry standards bodies to specify and implement
a set of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">web authentication APIs</a> which will
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/dev-guide/device/web-authentication">allow the use of key-based authentication technologies like Windows Hello with regular websites</a>,
which will hopefully eventually mean you won't have to have dozens of different passwords for each
website you visit, or reuse the same password everywhere and risk having all your accounts get
compromised.</p>
<p>My day-to-day work involves designing and implementing features and improvements to make Windows
Hello more secure and easier to use, and of course fixing bugs as they're found. Developers are also
responsible for writing and maintaining automated tests related to their features. Personally my
favorite part of the job is writing code, so I try to spend as much time as possible doing that.
Product managers (PMs) are responsible for mapping out the requirements, but in practice it's a very
collaborative process between PMs and developers, so there are often a lot of meetings to hash
things out.  Meetings aren't my favorite way to spend my time, but I am glad that developers get to
have input on the way features should work. The balance between design and coding varies a lot
depending on where we are in the release cycle; Microsoft still basically uses waterfall-style
development.</p>
<p>All of the code I write is in C++. On my team we make fairly heavy use of C++11 and C++14 (and soon
C++17) features, which have really modernized the language and made it much nicer to deal with.
Plus, trying to keep up with the latest additions to the C++ standard means I'm always learning new
techniques and tricks, which is fun.

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/12/27/early-access-roundup/">Steam Early Access Roundup</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I'm previewing three early access titles now available on Steam:
<em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/369200">Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online</a></em>,
<em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/">Rust</a></em>, and
<em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/393420">Hurtworld</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online</h3>
<p>...Tactical Combat Video Game Entertainment Simulation System. Okay, I made that
last part up, but somebody in Nexon America's marketing department really should
have reigned in that title a little bit. It can't even be made into a convenient
acronym. "Hey, want to play GITSSACFAO?" asked no one, ever.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I was drawn to this title because I love
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>
(as well as the
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_%28film%29">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>
films). If you're not familiar with the series, it follows a special forces team
led by Major Motoko Kusanagi in a sci-fi 2030s Japan where everyone who can
afford it is a cyborg.  (The overoptimistic timeline is worthy of <em>Back to the
Future</em>!) The setting is leveraged to deliver some surprisingly sophisticated
philosophical and social commentary&mdash;for an anime, anyway. But more to the
point, there's also a lot of over-the-top action and a hint of gun-fetishism,
which makes the series perfect for a first person shooter. It's surprising,
then, that nobody has tried to make one until now.</p>
<p><a href="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits1.jpg"><img alt="Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Whatever
Online" src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits1_thumb.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the results are mixed, at least at this early stage. I've seen
some significant stuttering during some matches, which is a real problem in such
a fast-paced shooter. The gunplay also is also ever-so-slightly off. It's got a
satisfying, weighty feel to it, but I can't quite get used to the aiming and
recoil. Adjusting your aim while looking down the sights is so incredibly slow
compared to the pace of player movement that the best strategy seems to be to
just never use iron sights at all except at extreme range. It feels like they're
taking cues from <em>Counter-Strike</em>, but they haven't quite nailed the experience
yet.</p>
<p>I trust that some of these issues will be fixed as the game is developed
further, but what's more worrying is the character progression mechanic.
Although early access to the game costs money, this is pretty clearly intended
to be a free-to-play game, and as such there are already a plethora of
unlockable weapon and ability upgrades. There are so many different things to
customize that it's almost overwhelming at first. That would be a good thing if
not for the fact that the pace of unlocks seems very slow (as if to encourage
people to spend real moneyâimagine that!), and the unlockables don't seem very
balanced. A fully upgraded character has clear advantages over a new character,
which leads to a frustrating sense of unfairness.</p>
<p><a href="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits2.jpg"><img alt="Remember when games had
gibs?" src="http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits2_thumb.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I think this one is worth keeping an eye on, but I don't see it becoming my
go-to shooter unless I end up being dead wrong about the free-to-play
monetization scheme.

<p><em>Fallout 4</em> is the latest in Bethesda's revival of Black Isle Studios' beloved
post-apocalyptic role playing series, and like its predecessors it has met with
much praise and market success. But I find myself unable to quite grasp the
popularity of the game, because also like its predecessors, <em>Fallout 4</em>'s
impressive scale and ambitious design are hamstrung by some major flaws in the

      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I keep forgetting to mention it, but this May was the fifth anniversary of
this blog. Thus, it's time again for some housekeeping.
<a href="/entry/2012/09/23/switching-to-octopress/">Three years ago</a> I stopped using
Wordpress for my blog and moved it to <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>.
Octopress is a great blogging framework, but its current incarnation
<a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">has some major shortcomings</a>.
Those will be fixed with Octopress 3.0, but 3.0 has been a long time coming, and
due to the changing distribution model the work to move from 2.0 to 3.0 may be
substantial. Plus, Octopress isn't the best fit for me because it's written in
Ruby, which I don't know and don't have much interest in learning; I much prefer
Python.</p>
<p>I recently learned of <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>, which is a
Python-based blogging tool. Luckily, Maurizio Sambati has already done the hard
work of
<a href="https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme">porting the Octopress theme to Pelican</a>.
Since my blog's theme is the Octopress theme with a few tweaks, it wasn't an
inordinate amount of work to
<a href="https://github.com/mlindgren/mlindgren-pelican-theme">port my own theme to Pelican</a>.
Jake Vanderplas also did some great work in
<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/pull/21">porting some of Octopress' Liquid tags</a>
to Pelican, and he also has
<a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/">a great blog post</a>
which walks through the process (and describes some of his reasons for
switching, which mirror my own). In the end, it did take me several hours of
work to move everything over and clean up some of the posts where I was making
use of various Octopress plug-ins, but I think it will be a boon in the long
run. (Please let me know if anything appears to be broken, as it's possible that
I missed something.)</p>
<p>In addition to being easier for me to use and contribute to, I'm really excited
about Pelican's support for tags. Tagging will help organize my blog,
especially since I've limited myself to having only a few categories since I'm
committed to having a unique, easily-distinguishable color for each one. I'm
also excited that Pelican has built-in support for
<a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html#translations">translating articles</a>,
which I plan to take advantage of to practice the languages I'm learning.</p>
<p>Check back in three years to see which new blogging platform I switch to next!</p></div>

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/09/25/tv-series-review-mr-robot/">TV Series Review: Mr. Robot, Season One</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don't watch a whole lot of TV. In fact, I don't even have cable. The only
shows I end up watching, therefore, are those I'm introduced to or I read about.
<em>Mr. Robot</em> is the latest such show; I read
<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/06/mr_robot_on_usa_finally_hollywood_created_a_realistic_hacker_character.html">David Auerbach's piece on it</a>
and was intrigued. In Auerbach's words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Real misfits&mdash;disturbing, unappealing, unlovable misfits&mdash;make for
poor Hollywood protagonists. It takes some faith to inject a genuinely
alienating hero into a film or TV show. But ever since the broader world of
tech has gained a whiff of cool over the past decade or so, Hollywood's
portrayals of hackers, programmers, and other screen-strapped geeks have
tended to sugarcoat the frequently unvarnished and even unappealing aspects of
a culture that prides itself on not caring about the mainstream. I'm not
bemoaning the lack of shy nerds with hearts of gold here, but of awkward and
even abrasive characters who talk too loudly, can't follow conversational
cues, transgress boundaries obliviously, and harbor conspiracy theories or
other unappealing ideas&mdash;like a lot of actual hackers out there. We
forget that people detest savant types for reasons beyond their smarts, and a
lack of social graces is one of them.</p>
<p>Elliot, the protagonist of the new USA Network drama <em>Mr. Robot</em>, comes far
closer to this type than an American television show has dared for a while.
(Elliot isn't the titular Mr. Robot&mdash;that's Christian Slater.) As played
by Rami Malek, Elliot doesn't have the charisma of Benedict Cumberbatch's
Sherlock or the anti-charisma of Hugh Laurie's Dr. House. Unlike Tony
Shalhoub's Adrian Monk, he's not a collection of quivering nerves and
endearing eccentricities. These characters&mdash;all nerds of one sort or
another&mdash;are fundamentally capable of functioning in society, and Elliot
really isn't. He and the world just don't hook up in the right way. Taking
copious drugs in order to function, he carries a vacant and flattened affect,
neither making eye contact with anyone nor turning away when they look at him.
With his emaciated face and sunken eyes, Malek gives an impression of
emptiness, paranoia, and above all disconnection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably a polarizing description: some people will be immediately
interested while others will probably question why anyone would want to watch
it. It was very much the former for me, possibly because Auerbach's description
of Elliot hits a bit close to home. I watched the first episode and was
instantly hooked. The show immediately draws you into its world: a sort of
dystopian present, a mirror image of our own reality, but viewed through the
eyes of a brilliant, cynical, emotionally troubled young man who struggles not
only with an unfeeling universe but also with drug addiction and mental
illness.</p>
<p>Atypically for movies and TV, Elliot's mental illness is depicted  respectfully
and at least somewhat accurately, too. He's not an over-the-top Hollywood
psycho, but merely a vulnerable person suffering from paranoia and delusions.
And being a software developer, I also really appreciated that the show nails
the technology.  It's not <em>completely</em> realistic, but that's to be expected; the
reality of programming and hacking is that they're slow, analytical processes,
often consisting of long stretches of thought punctuated by short bursts of
activity.  In other words, they're boring to watch, and sometimes to undertake,
too.  <em>Mr. Robot</em> strips that away, but it keeps the interesting aspects intact
without insulting the audience's intelligence with impossible technology,
meaningless invented jargon, or awful 3D
<acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>s.</p>

</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Some of this post is adapted from a Facebook comment I wrote earlier in the year in response to
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/farewell-america-canada-could-learn-a-few-things-from-you-1.3143760">this CBC article</a>.
Many of the statements in this post are conjecture based on my own experiences and perceptions; I do
not claim that everything in it is broadly applicable.</em></p>
<p>May of 2015 marked the beginning of my fourth year in the United States. Now that I have a green
card and don't have to worry quite as much about saying the wrong thing and getting kicked out of
the country, I wanted to take the opportunity to discuss what it's like to live here from my
perspective. I was going to write "from a Canadian perspective," but of course, I don't speak for
all Canadian immigrants.</p>
<p>Before I started my career, I had never really planned to come to the US. I was only part of the way
through my senior year at the University of Alberta when I happened upon a Microsoft recruiting
booth at a career fair. Microsoft was the only real technology company present; most of the others
were oil and gas companies, that being what Alberta's economy is primarily based on. I left a resume
with them, not really expecting much to come of it.</p>
<p>As it turned out, I did get a call back (which I almost missed&mdash;funny how such small events can
result in drastic changes in one's life). A few weeks and several highly stressful interviews later,
I had signed a job offer. Shortly after I graduated, my wife and I were on a plane to Seattle. Even
at that point, I didn't really expect to live in the States for more than a year or so. My goal was
primarily to get a "marquee company" on my resume (a piece of advice a friend and former colleague
gave me) and then use that as a bargaining chip to get a better job back home. But now it's been more
than three years, and not only am I still here, but I no longer have plans to leave in the
foreseeable future.</div>

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/07/29/windows-10/">Windows 10!</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Windows 10 is out today! This is the first release of Windows that I have worked
on as a developer , and I'm proud of what my team and Microsoft as a whole have
accomplished in the past year-and-a-half or so. Several tech websites have
already posted reviews, and so far the trend is very positive. A colleague of
mine posted some excerpts, which I'm going to borrow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows 10 represents the obvious future of PC operating systems. It makes Mac OS X feel old-fashioned, stuck in a time where The Desktop was a thing that mattered and the only way to access the Internet was through a browser.</p>
<footer style="text-align: right;">
David Pierce <cite><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/windows-10-review/">Wired</a></cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>So the question finally presents itself: should you upgrade your machine to Windows 10? Yes, you should.</p>
<footer style="text-align: right;">
Brad Sams <cite><a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-10-review-microsoft-goes-back-to-the-future">Neowin</a></cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The best part of Windows 10 is that it ends the cycle of good and bad in favor of something great.</p>
<footer style="text-align: right;">
Tom Warren <cite><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/28/9045331/microsoft-windows-10-review">The Verge</a></cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>It's nice, for once, to be able to recommend a new version of Windows without any hesitation.</p>
<footer style="text-align: right;">
Devindra Hardawar <cite><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/28/windows-10-review/">Engadget</a></cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are on a PC at all, Windows 10 is where you want to go. That it is free&mdash;for now&mdash;only makes the point simpler.</p>
<footer style="text-align: right;">
Alex Wilhelm <cite><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/28/the-windows-10-era-is-now/">Techcrunch</a></cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>If you haven't already done so, you can follow the instructions
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade">here</a> to get your
free upgrade.  It's very exciting to have played a role in the creation of the
latest and truly greatest version of Windows; I think this is a huge
achievement for Microsoft, and I'm happy to have been a part of it. The real
reward, though, is seeing people use and enjoy Windows 10&mdash;and that starts
today!</p></div>

        <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/05/22/game-review-bloodborne/">Game Review: Bloodborne</a>
      </h1>
</header>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>[I completed this review after playing Bloodborne for approximately 30 hours. I have finished the
game, but I have not discovered 100% of the content. I played the entire game solo, not using any
summons to help with boss fights. I have not yet participated in any PvP.]</em></p>
<p><em>Bloodborne</em> is the spiritual successor to From Software's <em>Demons Souls</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> series,
and its pedigree is clear right out of the gate. Upon starting the game, you'll enter the character
creation menu and be asked to choose from a number of classes with different stats, but will be
given almost no explanation of what the stats mean or how they affect gameplay. If you're a <em>Dark
Souls</em> veteran, you can make some educated guesses, but new players will be completely on their own.
After a short introductory sequence, you're thrown into an open world replete with buildings of
impossible scale, which stretches vast, seemingly endless distances in each direction. You're
completely on your own to make your path through this world, and there's no obvious "correct" route;
in fact, a friend and I found different bosses first, because we had taken different routes from the
start.</p>
<p>If this experience sounds like it might be frustrating for new players, that's because it absolutely
can be. Even for veterans of the series, the complete lack of guidance can feel punishing at times.
And yet, I can't stress how much I absolutely love it. The freedom not only to explore, but to truly
discover the workings of the world, and to make mistakes, is what made the <em>Souls</em> series what it
was, and <em>Bloodborne</em> continues this legacy. The game pays homage to times past, when games didn't
hold the player's hand throughout the entire experience, and it does so with such expertise and
craftsmanship that none of its contemporaries can compare.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors, <em>Bloodborne</em> adeptly balances challenging and sometimes frustrating gameplay
with frequent rewards and other powerful motivators: the prospect of discovering something new, of
overcoming the next challenging boss, of finding the next area, or of glimpsing another thread of
the world's deep backstory. These enticements work so well because of the depth and imagination with
which the world is crafted. There's a constant sense of cataclysmic urgency, but you won't truly
understand it until you take the time to piece together all of the subtle clues placed throughout
the world. <em>Bloodborne</em> gives you very little to go on, but it trusts you to have the fortitude and
curiosity to work things out for yourself.</div>
