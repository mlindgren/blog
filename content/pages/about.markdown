I'm a Canadian expat currently residing in Redmond, Washington, where I live
with [my wife](http://shayshortt.com) and my cat. I've lived in Redmond since
mid-2012, when I graduated from the University of Alberta with a Bachelor's
Degree in Computing Science and accepted a job with Microsoft. I continue to
work for Microsoft as a software developer.

My hobbies include snowboarding, hiking, music, programming, writing, and
tinkering with all manners of technology. I use this site to publish pretty much
everything I write that's fit for public consumption, as well as to catalog my
projects and serve as the canonical source of my online identity.  The opinions
expressed here are my own and do not represent the views of my employers or
colleagues, past or present.

### Review Policy

From time to time I write reviews of media such as books and video games. I have
no professional experience as a critic, and I do not attempt to provide an
"expert" opinion about any of the products I review. My reviews are primarily
written for my own benefit, as encouragement to write more frequently. That
said, I take the ethical implications of writing reviews very seriously.
Therefore, the following policies apply to all of my reviews:

1. I will not review Microsoft products, or products created by any other
company with which I have a professional relationship.
1. I will not review products created by companies whose employees I have a
personal relationship with.
1. I will not review products from any company I have a personal financial
interest in.
1. I will not review products for which any other conflict of interest exists.
1. If I review any product which I received for free or at a discounted price
due to personal connections (i.e. normal sales are excluded), I will disclose
that information in the review.
1. If there is any potential for a perceived conflict of interest or bias
towards a product I am reviewing, I will disclose that information in the review
and ensure I take all possible steps to mitigate it.

If you feel that any of my reviews fall short of these standards, please let me
know and I will do everything I can to address the issue.
