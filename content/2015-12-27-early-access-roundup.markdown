Today I'm previewing three early access titles now available on Steam:
_[Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online](http://store.steampowered.com/app/369200)_,
_[Rust](http://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/)_, and
_[Hurtworld](http://store.steampowered.com/app/393420)_.

### Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online
...Tactical Combat Video Game Entertainment Simulation System. Okay, I made that
last part up, but somebody in Nexon America's marketing department really should
have reigned in that title a little bit. It can't even be made into a convenient
acronym. "Hey, want to play GITSSACFAO?" asked no one, ever.

Anyhow, I was drawn to this title because I love <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex">
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> (as well as the <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_%28film%29">
Ghost in the Shell</a></em> films). If you're not
familiar with the series, it follows a special forces team led by Major Motoko
Kusanagi in a sci-fi 2030s Japan where everyone who can afford it is a cyborg.
(The overoptimistic timeline is worthy of _Back to the Future_!) The setting is
leveraged to deliver some surprisingly sophisticated philosophical and social
commentary&mdash;for an anime, anyway. But more to the point, there's also a lot
of over-the-top action and a hint of gun-fetishism, which makes the series
perfect for a first person shooter. It's surprising, then, that nobody has tried
to make one until now.

Unfortunately, the results are mixed, at least at this early stage. I've seen
some significant stuttering during some matches, which is a real problem in such
a fast-paced shooter. The gunplay also is also ever-so-slightly off. It's got a
satisfying, weighty feel to it, but I can't quite get used to the aiming and
recoil. Adjusting your aim while looking down the sights is so incredibly slow
compared to the pace of player movement that the best strategy seems to be to
just never use iron sights at all except at extreme range. It feels like they're
taking cues from _Counter-Strike_, but they haven't quite nailed the experience
yet.

I trust that some of these issues will be fixed as the game is developed
further, but what's more worrying is the character progression mechanic.
Although early access to the game costs money, this is pretty clearly intended
to be a free-to-play game, and as such there are already a plethora of
unlockable weapon and ability upgrades. There are so many different things to
customize that it's almost overwhelming at first. That would be a good thing if
not for the fact that the pace of unlocks seems very slow (as if to encourage
people to spend real moneyâ€”imagine that!), and the unlockables don't seem very
balanced. A fully upgraded character has clear advantages over a new character,
which leads to a frustrating sense of unfairness.

gibs?](http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits2_thumb.jpg)](http://files.mlindgren.ca/images/gits2.jpg)

I think this one is worth keeping an eye on, but I don't see it becoming my
go-to shooter unless I end up being dead wrong about the free-to-play
monetization scheme.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

### Rust
Have you ever wanted a reason to revile, fear and distrust humanity more
than you perhaps already do? _Rust_ is the game for you! I'm
incredibly late to the party with this game, and with the survival genre as a
whole; for a long time I felt, for no particular reason, that it just wasn't for
me. I suppose
_[Fallout 4](http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2015/12/20/game-review-fallout-4/)_
made me curious about what the genre had to offer. It turns out that
the answer is pain and misery.

Don't get me wrong, though. _Rust_ is actually an awesome game. Despite
still being in early access, it's very polished, has an excellent core
gameplay loop of gathering, building, and defending oneself, and is a lot
of fun to play. Although I only played _Rust_ over the course of a few
days, I managed to rack up 14 hours on it, which is more time than I
devote to most games these days. But therein lies the problem as well:
it's a time-sink of MMO-esque proportions. Except that it's even worse
than most MMOs, because when you're offline your sleeping body remains
where ever it was when you logged out, leaving you vulnerable to being
killed and having all of your stuff stolen. So not only does it take a lot
of time to progress, but you can easily lose all of your progress, and if
you're not constantly playing it becomes more and more likely that that will
happen. Look, I made an equation to describe the effect:

$$ \lim_{t \to several\ days} P(being\ murdered) = 1.0 $$ 

It doesn't help that most of the people who play _Rust_ are assholes.
During my 14 hours, I _once_ met some friendly players who gave me some
items to help me out. Almost every other time I came across someone, if
they had the means to kill me, they would, even when I was clearly not a
threat and had nothing of value to them. If _Rust_ is any indication of what a
real apocalyptic disaster would be like, I'm amazed that humanity made it out of
the jungle in the first place.

Still, I think _Rust_ is pretty awesome. The construction system is
neat. There are lots of cool items to craft. The maps are huge and fun
to explore. The sense of tension is unmatched in any other modern game.
If you have the time to devote to it, it's a great game. But I'm
probably never going to play it again, because the psychological cost
of wondering whether or not anything I've built will still be there
next time I log on is just too high.

### Hurtworld
A newer and lesser-known entry into the survival genre, _Hurtworld_ is
_Rust_ but with slightly more forgiving mechanics and cel-shaded
graphics. Oh, and no nudity. Did I mention that _Rust_ has nudity? It
does, but before you get too excited, all of the character models are
male. 

Anyway, back to _Hurtworld_: it describes itself as having "a focus
on deep survival progression that doesn't become trivial once you
establish some basic needs," presumably as opposed to its
competitors.  So far, what this seems to mean is that certain
resources are more difficult to acquire; you can't go from a basic
bow-and-arrow to a shotgun as quickly as you can in _Rust_. You can
also craft cars, which is pretty awesome. Of course, I never got that
far, because _Hurtworld_ is also pretty time-consuming. 

_Hurtworld_ is clearly the earliest of these three early access
games, and I ran into many technical issues while playing it. Lag
was a persistent problem, with frequent "de-syncs" where the server
thought something was in a different position than my machine did.
Some servers seemed to have serious stability issues, with frequent
disconnections. At other times, creature AI would stop working
entirely. Most importantly, the interface and combat mechanics are
very rough around the edges right now. 

It's too early to say anything definitive about _Hurtworld_, but it
could be a great alternative to _Rust_ for casuals like me who have
jobs and other boring adult responsibilites.
