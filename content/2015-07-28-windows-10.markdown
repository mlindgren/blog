Windows 10 is out today! This is the first release of Windows that I have worked
on as a developer , and I'm proud of what my team and Microsoft as a whole have
accomplished in the past year-and-a-half or so. Several tech websites have
already posted reviews, and so far the trend is very positive. A colleague of
mine posted some excerpts, which I'm going to borrow:

<blockquote>
<p>Windows 10 represents the obvious future of PC operating systems. It makes Mac OS X feel old-fashioned, stuck in a time where The Desktop was a thing that mattered and the only way to access the Internet was through a browser.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the question finally presents itself: should you upgrade your machine to Windows 10? Yes, you should.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best part of Windows 10 is that it ends the cycle of good and bad in favor of something great.</p>

<p>It's nice, for once, to be able to recommend a new version of Windows without any hesitation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are on a PC at all, Windows 10 is where you want to go. That it is free&mdash;for now&mdash;only makes the point simpler.</p>

If you haven't already done so, you can follow the instructions
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade) to get your
free upgrade.  It's very exciting to have played a role in the creation of the
latest and truly greatest version of Windows; I think this is a huge
achievement for Microsoft, and I'm happy to have been a part of it. The real
reward, though, is seeing people use and enjoy Windows 10&mdash;and that starts
today!
